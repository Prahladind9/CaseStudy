/**
 * Feature #4: Popularity Analysis
 *
 * Netflix maintains a popularity score for each of its titles.
 * This popularity score is derived from customer feedback, likes, dislikes, etc.
 * This score is updated weekly and added to the end of an array containing previous scores for the same title.
 * This score array helps Netflix identify titles that may be increasing or decreasing in popularity over time.
 * Some titles may be steady in popularity, increasing, decreasing, and fluctuating.
 * We want to identify and separate a title if it is gaining or losing popularity.
 *
 * Weâ€™ll be provided with an array of integers representing the popularity scores of a movie collected over a number of weeks.
 * We need to identify only those titles that are either increasing or decreasing in popularity,
 *  so we can separate them from the fluctuating ones for better analysis.
