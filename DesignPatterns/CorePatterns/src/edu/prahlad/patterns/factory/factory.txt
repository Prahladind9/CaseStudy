Factory
Hides the object creation process
Ex. Driver > Oracle, MySql, Plsql
    DriverManager.getConnection(String conString)
    here DriverManager is the Factory
    ToyFactory, CarFactory, ChocolateFactory

Steps
    Create Interface - which gathering all the steps required for class execution
    Implement interface w.r.t use-cases
    Create Factory class which has Interface - uses composition to resolve the respective implementation
    MainClass calls required implementation

Drawback
    For new use-case we have to modify Factory class
