Adapter Pattern
    When 2 Programs communicate with each other, one may have to adapt as per other requirements
Ex: WeatherFinder > find(city) - WeatherFinderImp
    WeatherUI - sends Zipcode
    WeatherAdapter > findTemperature(zipCode) > getCity & Call  WeatherFinder.findCity

Steps
    2Parties
    1 - Interface & its Implementation with one requirement, lets say based on input
    2 - Request's same result as 1, but has different input
    Then > Adapter Class acts as adapter - converts 2 input to as per 1 input & fetches the result
