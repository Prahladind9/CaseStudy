PrototypePattern > uses an existing object to create new objects
Cloning
    1) Shallow copy > Plain Java - Clone method
        The cloned object - inner class objects will have same reference/address
    2) Deep Copy > Overriding Java - Clone method
    3) Deep Copy > using copy constructor

Pro: We can create as many instance we want with the same state
Con: Inner classes, can make it complex, with a chance for circular reference error
