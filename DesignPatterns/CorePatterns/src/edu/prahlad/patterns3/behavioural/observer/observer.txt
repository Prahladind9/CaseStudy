Observer Pattern
Publishers (Subject) + Subscribers (Observers) > similar to newspaper or magazine

between a set of objects.
When the state of one object changes, all of its dependents are notified.

Loosely coupled designs allow us to build flexible OO systems that
can handle change because they minimize the interdependency between objects
